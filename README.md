Hack The Box. Network Traffic Analysis Project

This challenge provided valuable hands-on experience in network traffic analysis using Wireshark and TCPdump within a controlled lab environment. Through practical tasks such as capturing live traffic, filtering protocols like FTP, HTTP, and RDP, and extracting files from packet captures, I developed a deeper understanding of how to investigate suspicious network behavior.

I learned how to apply targeted filters effectively to isolate relevant traffic, follow communication streams to uncover hidden data, and use decryption keys to analyze encrypted sessions. These skills are essential in real-world incident response scenarios where identifying malicious activity quickly and accurately is critical. Overall, this challenge reinforced the importance of methodical traffic analysis and how powerful tools like Wireshark and tcpdump can aid in uncovering security incidents, helping to protect networks by identifying potential threats early. The knowledge gained lays a strong foundation for further exploration and mastery in cybersecurity and network forensics.
